# SushIA

This is the starting of a AI.

It must be like a budget JARVIS.

Now i am just making the visualization, the idea is to have cubes showing all the process of the AI and make like a "cloud of words" but with cubes showing the usage of CPU, memory, internet and number of active process, with different colors for each state (low, normal, high, overload).

Current state:
  I already did some of the visualization cubes and bound with the process and usage of CPU, but the use of CPU to render the cubes are too high, maybe i'll low the tick update.
